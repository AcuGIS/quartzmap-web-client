User Groups
=========

The User Groups page is used to add and edit User Groups.

All map permissions are Group based, so End Users you add to a User Group will have access to those map(s)

Add a Group
------------

To create a User Group, click the "Add New" button at top.

Once a User Group is created, you can add, edit, and remove Users via the Users page as well.
