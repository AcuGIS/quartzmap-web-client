You can customize the look, layout, and function of maps using below:

Map Index Header
------------------------

The index_header.php forms the header for each map you create.

It is located at /var/www/html/admin/incl/index_header.php

Snippets
--------------------

Each map is created from "snippets" contained in the /var/www/html/admin/snippets directory.

You can use these files to customize the layout and functionality of your maps.

Side Bar and Top Bar
------------------------------

The sidebar.php and topbar.php files are located at 

    /var/www/html/admin/incl/sidebar.php

    /var/www/html/admin/incl/topbar.php
